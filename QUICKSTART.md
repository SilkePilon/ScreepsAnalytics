## Default API Endpoint

The dashboard expects your Screeps server API to be available at:
```
http://127.0.0.1:3000/api
```

If your server runs on a different port or URL, update it in the Settings dialog.

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to load data" Error
1. Verify your Screeps server is running
2. Check the API URL in settings (should NOT end with `/api`)
3. Ensure your username and password are correct
4. Check browser console for detailed errors

### No Players Showing
- Wait 30-60 seconds for initial data load
- Click the refresh button
- Verify your server has active players
- Check that the shard name is correct

### Slow Performance
- Increase polling interval in settings
- Check your server's CPU usage
- Verify network connection to server

## Tips

- The polling interval determines how often data refreshes automatically
- Keep the minimum interval at 10000ms (10 seconds) to avoid overwhelming your server
- Settings are saved in your browser's localStorage
- Use the manual refresh button for immediate updates
- The table supports filtering by username for quick player lookup

## Next Steps

After setup, you can:
- Monitor player progression over time
- Track server population growth
- Identify top performers
- Analyze room control distribution
- Review detailed player statistics
